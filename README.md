# VIRTVETCLINIC
Veterinary clinics, also known as animal hospitals or animal clinics, are facilities that provide medical care for animals. These clinics are similar to hospitals for humans but specifically cater to the health needs of pets, livestock, and sometimes wildlife. Virtual reality has been utilized in them.
